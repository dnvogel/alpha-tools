# alpha-tools
Creational Tools and Utilities

#Every project starts somewhere

The intent of this project is to allow automation of the creation and inspirational processes that can take place when making anything.

This repository is also the open development playground of original author David Vogel and can contain just about any kind of code, working or not, in any language, and some of this code may seemingly have no purpose at all. That is why this is called "alpha" tools and not "beta" or "release".

Given the stated intent, this project can encompass a wide variety of solutions for multiple problem domains.
